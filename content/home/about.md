# Biography

Ryan Johnson is a Research Scientist at the Uniformed Services University. His research projects utlize large data sets generated from numerous high-throughput techniques including whole-genome sequencing, 16S sequencing, and various array-based tools to understand the interplay between microbial pathogens and human health. Current reserach interests include the gut microbiome and antimicrobial resistance.

-------------------

Ryan's graduate work investigated the nasal microbiome and how microbial composition can influence the development of remote skin and soft tissue infections in military trainees. Additional graduate work utilized various molecular and genetic techniques to study iron-uptake and pathogenesis in the Gram-negative bacterium _Helicobacter pylori_.

After obtaining his PhD in 2015, Ryan moved to the National Human Genome Research Institute within the National Institutes of Health (NIH) where he implemented whole-genome and metagenomic sequencing to track antibiotic-resistant microbes within hospital water systems.

Ryan currently works as a Research Scientist at the Uniformed Services University in Bethesda, Maryland. During his science career, he began to understand the importance that data science and reproducible research in the microbiology and bioinformatics fields and is thus motivated to share his experiences with others!
