<p>Iâ€™m gearing up to write a scientific manuscript and I want to try Rmarkdown for this. Iâ€™ve never used anything but Microsoft Word to write my manuscripts, and EndNote to manage my references. While Iâ€™m excited to try this out, I think the biggest challenge is going to be sharing my drafts with collaborators so that they can make edits (typically with <em>track changes</em> in microsoft word). Here are some of the key points that need to be addressed as I start researching methods for drafting manuscripts in Rmarkdown:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Needs to be reproducible.</strong> This is a given since I will be generating the manuscript using code, but I want to explore all the ways in which I can make elements of the paper reproducible/automated including table/figure generation, in-line code chunks, formatting, etc.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Needs to have an output compatable with Microsoft Word</strong>. While I donâ€™t necessarily like this point, itâ€™s a must as 99.99% of my collaborators will not know how to make edits to a Rmarkdown doc. Additionally, the <em>track changes</em> feature in word is the go-to for most scientists.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>An efficient and flexible reference manager</strong>. I know this is possible, just not aware of all the options currently available. Needs to be able to switch formats depending on the journal.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No major dependencies on LaTex.</strong> This is a personal limitation as my work computer does not have admin rights, so I canâ€™t install MacTex or Latex. But I think I can get away without using itâ€¦but I suppose weâ€™ll find out ðŸ˜¬.</p></li>
</ul>
<div id="setting-up-the-file-structure" class="section level1">
<h1>Setting up the File Structure</h1>
<p>I first created a new directory on my desktop, and within it I created a new R project called <code>test_manuscript.Rproj</code>.</p>
<p>Then I want to have a few subdirectories here. Once I will call <code>/data</code> and within it I will have <code>/data/processed</code> and <code>/data/raw</code>. The <strong>raw</strong> directory will contain the primary data files and once they have been cleaned/fixed up and are ready to be analyzed, I will place them into the <strong>processed</strong> directory. Each processing step should have a script associated with it. So letâ€™s also creat a <code>code/</code> directory.</p>
<p>Now while I do like that ability to place code directly into the manuscript, I actually prefer to have separate scripts that do this, and place the resulting figures in a spearate directory. So letâ€™s create a <code>/results</code> directory, and within it we can have <code>/results/figures</code> and <code>/results/tables</code>.</p>
<p>Here is what my directory now looks like:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="/post/2019-02-13-writing-a-scientific-paper-in-rmarkdown_files/dir_tree_1.png" />

</div>
</div>
<div id="the-data" class="section level1">
<h1>The Data</h1>
<p>As a mock example, I will use the data from the <code>iris</code> data set. I ran the following command just to get an actual csv file into the <code>data/raw</code> directory:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse)
write_csv(x = iris, path = &quot;data/raw/iris_data.csv&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Now this data is already pretty clean, but just to demonstrate what I imagine my typical workflow would beâ€¦letâ€™s create a script and place it in the <code>code/</code> directory that will analyze the iris data and spit out a new csv file that will be placed into the <code>data/processed</code> directory. Here is the script:</p>
<pre><code># Name: extract_setosa_versicolor.R
# Author: Ryan Johnson
# Date created: 12 February 2019
# Purpose: Extract the Setosa and Versicolor species
#   of flowers from the iris_data.csv data

library(tidyverse)

## Read in Data ------------------------
iris_data &lt;- read_csv(&quot;data/raw/iris_data.csv&quot;)

## Select Setosa and Versicolor -------------
iris_select &lt;- iris_data %&gt;% 
  filter(Species %in% c(&quot;setosa&quot;, &quot;versicolor&quot;))

## Write to processed
write_csv(x = iris_select,
          path = &quot;data/processed/setosa_versicolor.csv&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Letâ€™s now make a dummy table. Unfortunately, this is going to be the hardest part to automate. Iâ€™ve tried a bunch of ways to get nice png image of tables, but for right now I will generage scripts that produce html files. Iâ€™ll have to manually open them up and save them as screen shots. Kinda stinks but itâ€™s not like I will have hundreds of tablesâ€¦likely just a handful. I know there are packages out there (like <code>gt</code>â€¦which I like to use) that is working on implementing png exportable tables.</p>
<pre><code># Name: create_table1.R
# Author: Ryan Johnson
# Date: 12 February 2019
# Purpose: Generate table 1

library(tidyverse)
library(gt)
library(htmltools)


## Read in data -----------------------------------------------
iris_select &lt;- read_csv(&quot;data/processed/setosa_versicolor.csv&quot;)


## Generate gt table ------------------------------------------
table_1 &lt;- iris_select %&gt;% 
  group_by(Species) %&gt;% 
  summarise(mean_sepal_width = mean(Sepal.Width),
            mean_sepal_length = mean(Sepal.Length)) %&gt;% 
  gt() %&gt;% 
  as_raw_html(inline_css = TRUE)


## Export table into results/tables ---------------------------
write_file(table_1, &quot;results/tables/table1.html&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>And finally letâ€™s make a dummy figure.</p>
<pre><code># Name: create_fig1.R
# Author: Ryan Johnson
# Date: 12 February 2019
# Purpose: Generate figure 1

library(tidyverse)

## Read in data -----------------------------------------------
iris_select &lt;- read_csv(&quot;data/processed/setosa_versicolor.csv&quot;)


## Create Figure -----------------------------------------------
iris_plot &lt;- ggplot(data = iris_select, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = Species))


## Save Plot -----------------------------------------------
ggsave(plot = iris_plot, filename = &quot;results/figures/fig1.png&quot;)</code></pre>

<div id="the-manuscript" class="section level1">
<h1>The Manuscript</h1>
<p>After doing a bit of research, here is a bare-bones manuscript Rmarkdown file that I think will satisfy my needs:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="/post/2019-02-13-writing-a-scientific-paper-in-rmarkdown_files/manuscript.png" />

</div>
<p>Much of this may seem self-explanatory, but some stuff not so much. So first, letâ€™s understand what I did for referencesâ€¦</p>
</div>
<div id="adding-references" class="section level1">
<h1>Adding References</h1>
<p>And now for a part that can be very complicatedâ€¦adding references. It seems to me that the best way to organize your references is to place them into a <strong>BibTex</strong> document. Iâ€™ve pulled a few of my own papers from google scholar and converted them to BibTex format by selecting them and then exporting as BibTex:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="/post/2019-02-13-writing-a-scientific-paper-in-rmarkdown_files/bibtex.png" />

</div>
<p>I then saved the resulting file as <code>my_refs.bibtex</code>:</p>
<pre><code>@article{johnson2015correlation,

<p>I also had to add a <strong>csi style</strong> to tell R how to format the references. I copied the <strong>American Society for Microbiology</strong> style from <a href="https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles">this website</a>, and saved it as <code>asm.csi</code>. Then in my yaml header (the top portion of the manuscript within the two â€”), you need to tell R what bibtex library to use, and what style using the <code>bibliography</code> and <code>csi</code> arguments. You can then reference any article using the notation you see in the manuscript â€“&gt; <span class="citation">[@johnson2015correlation]</span></p>
</div>
<div id="referencing-figures-and-tables" class="section level1">
<h1>Referencing Figures and Tables</h1>
<p>This is pretty straightforward, feed the path to your png image to the <code>knitr::include_graphics(&quot;path/to/figure.png&quot;)</code>. I opted for this method rather than the <code>![](path/to/figure)</code> as, I was told, it provide more flexibilityâ€¦but for now, it works and looks pretty good.</p>
</div>
<div id="generate-manuscript" class="section level1">
<h1>Generate Manuscript</h1>
<p>Now, this is what my directory now looks like:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="/post/2019-02-13-writing-a-scientific-paper-in-rmarkdown_files/dir_tree_2.png" />

</div>
<p>To publish the manuscript to a word document, click on arrow next to the <code>knitr</code> button and select <code>Knit to Word</code>. This will create a word document of your final manuscript! Mine looks like this:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="/post/2019-02-13-writing-a-scientific-paper-in-rmarkdown_files/word_1.png" />

</div>
<div class="figure">
<img src="/post/2019-02-13-writing-a-scientific-paper-in-rmarkdown_files/word_2.png" />

</div>
<div class="figure">
<img src="/post/2019-02-13-writing-a-scientific-paper-in-rmarkdown_files/word_3.png" />

</div>
</div>
<div id="automating-with-makefile" class="section level1">
<h1>Automating with makefile</h1>
<p>So the last thing I want to talk about is making everything automatedâ€¦so that basically all I have to do is type <code>make paper</code> and all of the necessary code is re-run to make everything up to date and produce a finished paper.</p>
<p>If youâ€™re not familiar with makefiles (and Iâ€™m very much a novice), Pat Schloss has an entire youtube series on <a href="http://www.riffomonas.org/reproducible_research/">reproducible research and covers makefiles for beginners</a>â€¦and itâ€™s where I got started!</p>
<p>I created a file called <code>makefile</code> and placed it in my main directory. Here is what mine looks like:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="/post/2019-02-13-writing-a-scientific-paper-in-rmarkdown_files/makefile.png" />

</div>
<p>Key points with makefile:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Be sure each R command is indented with a TAB</p></li>
<li><p>Each rule is formated as <code>Target : Dependency</code>. If you have multiple dependencies, break them up line by line and be sure that each one (except for the last one) ends with a <code>\</code>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Then, once your in your home directory, you can open the terminal and type <code>make manuscript.docx</code>. If all runs smoothly you should see this in your console:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="/post/2019-02-13-writing-a-scientific-paper-in-rmarkdown_files/make_output.png" />

</div>
<p>Now here is the cool partâ€¦if you make any changes to say the code for figure 1, or code for table 1â€¦or ANY dependency for the manuscript, the make command will rerun that code and make sure itâ€™s up to date and then will generate a new manuscript for you!</p>
<p>Hope this helpsâ€¦as it really helped me get up and running with writing a manuscript in Rmarkdown. There are still tons of thing you can do to customize your document, but this should get you up and running!</p>
