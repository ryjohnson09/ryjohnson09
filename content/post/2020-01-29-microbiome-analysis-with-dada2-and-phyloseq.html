<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>The purpose of this post will be to guide researchers through a basic analysis of microbiome data using R packages <code>DADA2</code> and <code>Phyloseq</code>. Most concepts will be discussed at a very high level and I won’t spend too much time digging into the weeds of the analysis.</p>
<p>We will be analyzing a very small subset of data that was used in part to look at differences in microbiome structure between mice given a regular diet (<strong>RD</strong>, n = 24) versus a diet with no isoflavones (<strong>NIF</strong>, n = 24). Fecal samples from each mouse were collected 2 weeks after being fed either the RD or NIF diets. Samples were processed in the lab and subjected to Illumina MiSeq 300 base paired-end sequencing. We specifically targeted the V4 variable region of the 16S rRNA gene for sequencing. Reads from each sample were subsampled to 5000 reads/sample just to make the data a bit more manageable.</p>

<h1>Set Up Your Environment</h1>
<p>Before we can get started, there are a few things you’ll need to download/install:</p>
<div id="the-microbiome-data" class="section level3">
<h3>The Microbiome Data</h3>
<p>The data has been compressed into a single <code>tar.gz</code> file. You’ll need to download it and de-compress it. This can usually be done by simply double-clicking on it.</p>
<p>Download the data <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HCcMQASYweEYrjTQUxuHeaQ07FlJf-3U/view?usp=sharing">here</a></p>
</div>
<div id="download-and-install-necessary-r-packages" class="section level3">
<h3>Download and Install necessary R packages</h3>
<p>In order to get <code>DADA2</code>, <code>Phyloseq</code>, and a few other packages installed on your computer, you need to install them from the internet. Some of these packages can take a while to install, so don’t be alarmed if it take a couple minutes. <code>DADA2</code> and <code>Phyloseq</code> are held within Bioconductor, which a collection of packages used primarily for biological data analysis, so you’ll need to install Bioconductor prior to installing <code>DADA2</code> and <code>Phyloseq</code>. Once all packags are installed, you won’t have access to them until you “turn them on” using the <code>library()</code> command.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span style="color: red;"><strong>DADA2</strong></span>: Please follow the directions from this <a href="https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/dada-installation.html">website</a>. This is the package that does much of the “heavy” lifting in terms of read quality processing and error rate detection.</p></li>
<li><p><span style="color: red;"><strong>Phyloseq</strong></span>: Please follow the directions from this <a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/phyloseq.html">website</a>. This package is primarily used to process the high-quality reads, generate diversity statistics, and make pretty figures.</p></li>
<li><p><span style="color: red;"><strong>Tidyverse</strong></span>: This is a suite of packages that are used for variety of data science needs (read/write files, clean/edit data, make cool figures, etc). To install, simply enter <code>install.packages(&quot;tidyverse&quot;)</code> into your R prompt.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These two blocks of code should install and load all of the packages needed:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># DADA2 install
if (!requireNamespace(&quot;BiocManager&quot;, quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages(&quot;BiocManager&quot;)
BiocManager::install(&quot;dada2&quot;, version = &quot;3.10&quot;)

# Phyloseq install
if (!requireNamespace(&quot;BiocManager&quot;, quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages(&quot;BiocManager&quot;)
BiocManager::install(&quot;phyloseq&quot;)

# Tidyverse install
install.packages(&quot;tidyverse&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code># Load packages
library(dada2)
library(phyloseq)
library(tidyverse)</code></pre>
